  "A unidirectional path tracer, written so that most of what it claims can be
  checked against a number rather than looked at.

  Path tracing is an estimator of the rendering equation, and estimators are
  easy to get subtly wrong: a missing 1/pi in the BRDF, a cosine applied twice,
  a PDF that does not match the sampling — each produces an image that looks
  like a render and is not the answer. So the design here is arranged around
  cases with known values:

  - **The white furnace.** Put a convex diffuse object of albedo 1 inside a
    uniform environment of radiance L. Every path that leaves the surface
    escapes and collects L, and the throughput after a Lambertian bounce with
    cosine-weighted sampling is exactly the albedo — the 1/pi in the BRDF, the
    cosine, and the pdf cancel. So the answer is L with ZERO variance, and any
    of those three factors being wrong shows up as a bias, not as noise. With
    albedo rho the answer is rho L, equally exactly.
  - **Two estimators, one answer.** Next-event estimation and brute-force
    hemisphere sampling compute the same integral by different routes, so they
    have to agree within their own error bars.
  - **The rate.** Monte Carlo error falls as 1/sqrt(N); quadrupling the samples
    has to halve it.

  The generator is an explicit int32 xorshift, so the same seed gives the same
  image on the JVM and in a browser — a frame that cannot be re-rendered
  identically cannot be compared with anything.

  Not here: specular and glossy BSDFs, refraction, participating media,
  textures, motion blur, spectral rendering, bidirectional or Metropolis
  transport, and multiple importance sampling — with only diffuse surfaces and
  uniform lights the two estimators here do not need a weighting scheme, and
  writing one that is never exercised would be decoration."
